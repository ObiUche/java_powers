# Power Calculator - Java Method Implementation
## Overview

This Java program calculates the result of raising a number to a specified power using a custom method. The implementation leverages Java's built-in Math.pow() function for the calculation.
File Information

    Filename: Main.java

    Purpose: Calculate n raised to the power of m (n^m)

Code Structure

The program consists of:

    A main method that handles user input and output

    A custom method called power() that performs the exponentiation

Custom Method Details
power(int n, int m)

    Parameters:

        n: The base number

        m: The exponent

    Returns: A long value representing n raised to the power of m

    Logic: Uses Math.pow() for the calculation, then converts the result to long

How to Use

    Compile the program: javac Main.java

    Run the program: java Main

    Enter two integers when prompted (separated by space or new line)

    The program will display the result of n^m
